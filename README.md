# subcode

## what is this?
my college requires me to submit programming assignments in the form of a document (.docx / pdf) with output attached which is a tedious task. 
 
solution: subcode is a script written in `Python3` to speed up this process by reducing manual labour.

## how to setup? 
 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/viveknathani/subcode.git 
pip3 install fpdf
```

## how to run?
```bash
python3 path_to_subcode_script path_to_code_file command_to_run_for_output name_of_generated_pdf
```
